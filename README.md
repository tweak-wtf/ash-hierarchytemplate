# ash-hierarchytemplate
An AYON Addon for creating initial project folder hierarchies.

Depends on a running AYON service instance and the `ashHierarchyTemplate` project attribute.

> 📝 The `ashHierarchyTemplate` attribute will be created on first caught `entity.project.created` event which requires a server reboot.

## Settings

> 📝 If new templates have been configured please ensure these are available as keys in the `ashHierarchyTemplate` attribute's `enum` property.
